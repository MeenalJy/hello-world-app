## Introduction

In today's software development landscape, the practice of DevOps plays a pivotal role in ensuring seamless collaboration between development and operations teams. One of the essential aspects of DevOps is automating the software delivery process through deployment pipelines. In this project, I'll walk you through the steps I took to create a deployment pipeline for a simple Python "Hello World" application using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- A Python environment set up on your local machine.

## Workflow Overview

The deployment pipeline I'll build consists of the following steps:

1. **Linting**: Check the Python code for any syntax or style issues.
2. **Testing**: Run unit tests to ensure the code functions as expected.
3. **Building**: Package the application, if needed.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a target environment (for this example, we'll keep it simple and deploy it to a local directory).

## Workflow Configuration

The pipeline workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. This file contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration that automates the deployment process. The workflow is triggered on each push to the `main` branch.

## Conclusion

I've successfully set up a deployment pipeline for a basic Python "Hello World" application using GitHub Actions.
